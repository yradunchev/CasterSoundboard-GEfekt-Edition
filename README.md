## Build from source

You can specify the target directory using the `PREFIX` `qmake` variable (default: `/usr`).

Now run `qmake`, this will auto generate a makefile:

```
$ qmake PREFIX=/usr/local
```

Then run `make` to build the project:

```
$ make
```

And finally run `make install` to install the app:

```
# make install
```

Now you're good to go!
